# This project is part of Softuni's educational program. 
### The course's objectives are to create a functional website with CRUD operations using React. A backend is required, but is free of choice. The website needs to have dynamic pages, authentication, forms/validation, etc.

## Gameblob (website name) is the result for my project
### Gameblob is a website where users get authenticated, can search for games via IGDB's API and can add games to their libraries. 

### Users can upload screenshots to their games, which will get displayed in a carousel and can still access IGDB's game information from their profile page. Each user's profile page features sections for changing personal information, email, password and deleting the account altogether.

### The home page is different depending on whether the user is authenticated or not and some sections of the website (e.g. library/profile) are not visible to guests.

### The front-end is built on React/Javascript using SCSS as the styling framework. The back-end is linked to Firebase (NoSQL database and queries), data is brought to the website via IGDB's API (SQL query).
